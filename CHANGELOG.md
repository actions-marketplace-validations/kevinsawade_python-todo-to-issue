[1.0.0] - 2021-07-12

unidiff now only passes .py files to ast. Workflow seems to be set up./
Issues are created as expected.
GitHub tagging still a bit borked. Had to release 1.0.0, because 0.0.1 results in the wrong/old action being run via nektos/act.

[0.0.1] - 2021-07-12

First release. Unittests are passing. Added a Dockerfile and an action.yml.
Getting ready to create release and publish the action on the GitHub Marketplace.
