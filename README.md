# python-todo-to-issue

A repository containing a github workflow/action that scans diffs for todos and creates issues from them.

# Quickstart

- Create a token with the issue scope and add it as a repository secret. Let's say, we call it GITHUB_TOKEN
- Create a file at `.github/workflows/todo-to-issue.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: Todo-to-Issue

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  todo-to-issue:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create Issues ‚úîÔ∏è
        uses: kevinsawade/python-todo-to-issue@latest
        with:
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Write Todos

Now you can start writing todos and they will be raised as issues, when you push to github:

```python
# todo: This is a simple in-line todo. This will be the title of the issue.

# todo (kevinsawade): I will fix this weird contraption.

# Todo: This is the title of a mutli-line issue.
#  This is the body of the multi-line issue. Here, you can specify
#  What needs to be done to fix this issue. Issues are automatically
#  closed, once the issue is removed from the file. You can set assignees,
#  labels and milestone like so:
#  assignees: kevinsawade, github_user3
#  labels: devel, bug
#  milestone: release
```

Besides these in-line todos, google-style docstring todos will also be picked up.

```python
def myfunc(arg1):
    """This is the overview docstring.
    
    This is more detailed info to the function `myfunc`.
    
    Args:
        arg1 (str): Argument `arg1` should be of type `str`.
    
    Todo:
        * Single-line todos are introduced as a single bullet-point.
        * This line becomes the title of the github issue.
        * (kevinsawade) Assignees are put into parentheses.
        * Titles for multi-line todos are also bullet-points.
            But the body is indented according to google's styleguide.
            Assignees, labels and milestones are added similar to the in-line
            comments todos.
            assignees: kevinsawade, github_user2
            labels: devel, bug
            milestone: alpha
    """
    return 'Hello' + arg1
```
